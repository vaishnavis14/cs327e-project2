This project involves exploring and analyzing the Pagila database, a PostgreSQL implementation of a sample DVD rental store schema. Utilizing SQL queries, I performed various joins and data manipulations to extract meaningful insights, such as rental history by customers, relationships between films and actors, and the distribution of addresses in different cities. The analysis demonstrates advanced SQL techniques, including inner, outer, and self-joins, to uncover patterns in rental and inventory data.
